1,"The government should pay for research, and private companies should pay for using the results of this research.","For sure one of the factors is that the objects in question are so far away, and we have no control over them. There's garbage in space, but nobody owns it and so there's no incentive to remove it.Also, for private companies it is important to find a leverage that yields the most results, even if you apply just a little bit of pressure. State might afford to invest in a technology that requires significant efforts, but has a diluted impact; but a company would always want to get maximum results for minimum efforts.",
2,"Those who are suffering from space debris are the ones to pay. In other words, everybody. It is a tragedy of commons. If you are not going to space yourself, you are suffering from the problem passively.","You need to find a pain-point. An example of a pain-point is when you want to launch a space asset, you need to avoid the zones of high space debris concentration. Once your asset is in space, it is stuck. The volume of space debris is growing and the market is suffering from not knowing where these space debris are, how many they are and what size they are. So, two key questions to ask: what is the pain-pont and how much does the pain cost?  The technology needs to be clear and intuitive to enter the market. Removing space debris and making space more sustainable seems to have very little incentives right now for private companies. It is good to have EPFL working on it [sustainable space technologies] as a start. If there would be private companies doing sustainable space technologies, their funding would come from governments or companies like SpaceX, because they would understand that they could run out of space in space. So, another factor is to have enough financial resources, like big players do. SpaceX are the market: they have become the benchmark of the market. All companies will look up to what big players do.","Training your model with synthetic images that closely resemble reality can work. Ensure the data makes sense and is interpretable. While curves and graphs are good, they need to be translated into meaningful values for those not involved in the technical details. Add an interface that makes the data comprehensible to a general audience or a business developer. Use synthetic data for initial training and then validate the model with real data to ensure accuracy. A proof of concept shows feasibility but needs to be validated with real data to reach the minimum viable product (MVP) stage. For commercializing space debris removal, understanding the market and incentives is crucial. Entities like EPFL and ClearSpace are beginning to tackle this issue, but larger players like SpaceX may not be the right customers as they have significant resources and market control. Focusing on smaller companies that can benefit from your solution might be more effective. Engage with companies working on debris assessment and data collection to understand how they quantify existing debris. This collaboration can help validate and improve your model. Smaller companies are often more open to discussions and can provide valuable insights and data."
3,"Certainly a combination of both. It is similar to ensuring sustainability on Earth: governments either subsidize companies or make them pay taxes. It is unrealistic to expect companies to bear the financial burden of implementing sustainable technologies alone, in space or any other sector. If only governments make sustainability efforts, the effects will be negligible because companies have an enormous impact on the environment.","First of all, cost. Sustainability is often just a side effect while companies chase cost reduction. For example, Elon Musk’s rockets were designed to make access to space cheaper, but they are also more sustainable because they are reusable. However, this might be false sustainability due to the rebound effect: the less it costs, the more you launch, offsetting the positive effect of reusability. Then, legal compliance. This is how sustainability is pushed on Earth, and space should be no exception. For space, since we cannot directly see what is happening there, we cannot feel how the situation is deteriorating or improving. We, as people, will only start caring about space sustainability when the situation is truly catastrophic. Before that, we will focus on our own, earthly problems. Until a devastating event, like the destruction of communication satellites by space debris, people will not truly care, which means they will not push their governments to act. This, in turn, means there won’t be any regulations in place. Legislation is the most powerful tool to ensure sustainability. Make it mandatory!",
6,"Ideally, all governments should ensure that companies pay, and not only those of the few spacefaring nations but all nations, because every country benefits from space. But in reality, it is like dumping plastic into the ocean: we can regulate it at the United Nations level, but ultimately, policing it must be at the level of national jurisdiction to ensure compliance. For example, if you want to launch something, but the country where you are makes you pay a sustainability tax, you would say, ""OK, then I am going to the US"" and avoid paying the tax. Then there is no sustainability.","As I said previously, it is the jurisdiction. Also, unfortunately, companies will not act unless they perceive a real danger. If there is so much space debris that the risk of collision is catastrophic, it would make economic sense to pay for sustainable solutions. Space debris is not the only problem in space, but from what I know, it is the most urgent one. Companies and governments will first act to solve the most pressing and immediately threatening problem.","I believe such a repository should be open-source. The ultimate goal is to contribute to space sustainability by improving debris tracking and potentially aiding in debris removal, and there is no use in it unless it is a collective effort. The only way to ensure that as many actors as possible are on board is to provide unrestricted access to the technology and persuade them that it is necessary."
7,"It is not easy to commercialize sustainability in space. Governments can subsidize companies. Essentially, governmental money is always involved in sustainability. It is either a technology developed with public money and then rented out to private companies, or it is a governmental order, B2G. There can be an illusion of private activities involved, but in the end, governmental money is behind it.","Nowadays, companies keep launching satellites with relatively few inhibitions. One factor is clear international regulations and criteria for companies to follow. However, jurisdictional issues complicate enforcement, as regulations from entities like the European Union may not apply globally. Space debris is a recognized problem, with some startups beginning to address it. What can really push more startups to enter this market is cutting-edge research at universities, once again, backed by public funding. In other words, a government pays an institution to develop a complicated technology over a long period of time, and then there is a spin-off company using this technology. Another factor is technological capabilities. To be successful on the market, a technology needs to be efficient and solve several key problems at once, for example, reducing costs by reducing fuel consumption, and therefore being greener, which positively contributes to a company’s image.","I have doubts that companies would be able to use such a technology, even if they were willing to pay for it. Concerns about security and jurisdiction arise when observing objects in space, particularly military satellites."
8,"Both, but the main push needs to come from the government, because companies exist to make profit. Anything else would be a burden for a company, so it needs to be either subsidized by the governments, or enforced.","One significant factor is the existence of international agreements like the charter for space sustainability established by ESA. This charter sets a framework for industry practices. Additionally, institutional-level discussions are important and they are, thankfully, actively ongoing, because we need policy-making to support sustainable space initiatives.Technological advancements play a crucial role as well. For many years, efforts have been dedicated to developing technologies that can alter the way objects burn up in the atmosphere, thereby reducing space debris and mitigating the impact on the Earth's environment.Clear and effective regulatory frameworks are needed to ensure compliance and to promote widespread private adoption of sustainable practices. Another aspect worth mentioning is that space sustainability has to be recognized as a domain of strategic interest. Only then can it get the necessary attention, resources, support, and bring meaningful changes to the space sector, and all the sectors connected to it, because we also have downstream companies, like telecom, data science centers, farmers, etc.","First, the value is in the capability to identify pattern changes in orbits and track objects in orbit. It is difficult to say whether this is sufficient to build a business. It would be very hard to find customers. You should start with the question: “What are we doing and who are we doing it for?”. From my perspective, what you are doing relates to security and defense, so this might be your starting point. The next question is: “What differentiates you from the others?”. There already exist companies working on SSA, tracking and surveillance. Once you have pinpointed your value proposition to the market, you can address ESA, because they are actively identifying future technological needs."
23,"Neither. There are enough problems on Earth, we need to solve them first. If we didn’t finance space activities, we could have allocated this money to other, more pressing needs. How to make space sustainable? Stop all space activities altogether.","Space sustainability technologies are crazy ideas. They are unnecessary and not economically viable. The Internet can be done on earth without the use of space technologies. Natural disaster prediction cannot be done without space, but we can live without it, like we have always lived. Casualties from natural catastrophes are inevitable, people die, and it's the natural order of things. Space tech is unnecessary, and sustainable space tech even more so. There is now no need and no urgency. Maybe in 100 years, it all will be more relevant.",
24,"Surely not the private companies. Governments may invest some resources, but not anytime soon, because it is not the most urgent matter.","The market will only be ready to adopt something when there is an absolutely pressing need, and this is not the case with sustainable space tech. Therefore, as of today, there is 0 commercial potential. Will there be some? In the near future, no. It is hard to tell for sure what the market will be like in decades or centuries, but there is a slim possibility that such a need will arise at some point, because space exploration is not a necessity itself. It is surely interesting, but the market is more (literally) down-to-the-ground.",
25,"It should be partially states and partially private companies. Especially the big and rich companies, like SpaceX. And they are already doing something in this direction, for example, reusable launchers.","Certainly, there is potential for the adoption of sustainable space technologies by private companies; there is a market for it because sustainability also means fewer risks, and companies are generally willing to pay for reducing their risks. At least, I am judging from the perspective of terrestrial industries, where risk mitigation is an important aspect, and I do not see why the space sector would be different.In order to be adopted by private companies, such technologies must be affordable. Also, the laws must change. Regulations are the main driver. We have the same thing in the cement industry. Overall, the technologies must be reliable, safe and affordable.",
26,"States active in space exploration. Why? For a good image, like in any other sustainable tech initiative. As for the states which are not major players in the space sector, it would be next to impossible to incentivize them to partake in sustainable space initiative, since they would not feel the weight of responsibility for their prior activities and they would not see much use in it, since they are not actively exploiting space and rely on the space-based services provided by other countries. Also, a tax should be introduced on all space-dependent services, such as GPS. Given the number of users, such a tax would be infinitesimal for one user, but tangible enough, when accumulated, to finance sustainable space solutions and enable continuous functioning of such services. In other words, every space-active company should pay a ‘sustainability tax’, and that tax should be relayed onto users.","These are technologies on demand. So, the main factor for a private company to be interested in such a technology, is an urgent and important need, like collision avoidance or decision to which orbit to go. But private companies will never fully invest in such a technology, because the financial burden would not justify the occasional need. Sustainable space technologies would not be fully commercially viable, therefore, there will always be the need for governmental subsidies.","A potentially interesting and viable model is XaaS. When the government/space agencies bear the costs of the development of a sustainable space technology, and then rent it out to companies, other states on demand. For example, in the case of the BRIDGE project, EPFL will remain the owner of the tech/software/repository, and organizations/companies/agencies could rent it when they need it."
27,"The responsibility lies with those who caused this pollution. If it was caused by governments, then they should address it; if it was caused by companies, then they should take responsibility. Everyone should be involved in closing the loop.","The rate of commercialization will depend on the severity of the pollution problem. I don't have a good idea of the scale of the problem. Yes, we launch a lot, but space is also vast. So, I want to know what the threshold for a problematic level of pollution is. Are we at 1% pollution level or 0.000001%? If it's the latter, then there may not yet be a market for sustainable space tech. People would likely invest in something more urgent and tangible.   How useful are these technologies? Law - the main driver, as in any industry, when it comes to sustainability. Challenges: Space is so distant, so there would not be that much public attention, it is not as visible as the effects on the Earth. So the problem needs to become extremely grave for people and the media to start somehow noticing it. All space solutions are very costly. Sustainable and unsustainable alike. So, how will you drive public opinion - is the key question? If it is that much costly, the public opinion needs to be extremely strong to override this challenge and push governments and companies to act. Just like in other sectors.",
28,"The costs should be shared among all stakeholders, including businesses and states, as these technologies would be quite resource-intensive in terms of money and personnel. While I'm not very familiar with this problem, I understand that it is starting to grow. I know that there are many constellations like Starlink and its competitors, as well as governments using satellites for defense purposes. They should contribute financially.","As with every sustainable technology, sustainable space technologies will likely be introduced with government aid. Before a company can expect any return, it needs some support from the state. Therefore, the first factor is the nudge from the state.It is also possible that companies will recognize the problem and take initiative, but I am not certain that will happen.I see the same set of problems as in other sectors with sustainable technologies. There is no immediate profit, so I do not see a strong motivation for companies to take such initiatives, but hopefully I am mistaken.","Once again, I do not see why companies would voluntarily pay for it. I believe the only way to get your technology recognized is to open-source it. However, I am not an expert, and I might be overlooking something."
29,"I see massive potential in commercialization of sustainable space technologies. As for who needs to pay, I think it should be some form of tax on all the companies who build satellites; and all the states that launch satellites need to implement sustainable solutions financed from those taxes and from their budget.","Space is owned by everyone and no one, like the oceans, so the issue is that a private company would be the sole bearer of costs, but the benefits will be distributed among all actors, including its competitors. I think cost-effectiveness would be the main driver of adoption: to implement a sustainable technology must be cheaper than to deal with the problems that arise if you do not implement it. And pressing need, but that's going to be in a while, because, from what I know, the situation is not yet catastrophic in space. And then because there's a lot of military usage, there's probably an incentive for space nations who use it, to make sure it stays clean.","Your potential customer is whoever launches a new satellite - governments or companies, so that they know they won’t get in the way of space debris."
30,"For the moment, space business is still closely intertwined with governments. For example, SpaceX is called a private company, but there is a lot of public money flowing in, therefore it's not really a private company. Is there a way to make money without governmental aid? Not sure. It's truly difficult to become a fully private, profitable company. There needs to be a legal framework requiring all satellite operators to have a plan to clean up space debris once their satellites reach the end of their operational lives. Yet, various challenges make it difficult to establish a profitable framework for private companies to ensure that. Nonetheless, if a company launches a satellite, it should be responsible for cleaning up orbital debris.","The legal framework is crucial, as legislation holds significant power compared to other factors. It is easier to incentivize the prevention of orbital pollution than to clean it up afterward. For instance, we can enact regulations requiring satellite operators to dispose of their satellites without leaving debris in orbit. However, dealing with existing objects in orbit, especially military or classified ones, poses additional challenges. Private companies may be reluctant to bear the cost of removing them. Also, private companies are ‘lazy’. They want a quick, efficient solution that would not cost them a lot of money, time and effort. Governments are more patient and have deeper pockets.","Who could be interested - entities that would like to clean or to launch new satellites, to avoid collisions; actors that would like to control and to enhance databases with objects, and more data on the object. Because if you have the shape, the rotation, and information on how the object changes over time; then if you ever collect data on a collision, this could be interesting. Imagine tackling Earth pollution, focusing solely on CO2 and microparticles. It's challenging, right? Now, picture extending that effort to satellites and space debris. As space gets more congested, launching satellites becomes increasingly tricky. There's a tipping point looming. It's unfortunate that we often reach a crisis point before taking action, like a messy teenager's room - it won’t be cleaned until it is impossible to cross it.Consider ClearSpace, for instance. While it's a great initiative, operating profitably in such a niche market is tough. There's a complex interplay between private companies, governments, and military interests. Who foots the bill? What about legalities? Ensuring compliance and enforcement across various jurisdictions is no small feat. Factor in diverse national interests—like those of China, for instance—and navigating this landscape becomes even more complicated."
31,"Mostly governments, but they can also either force or incentivise companies to participate in sustainable transition. By ‘forcing’ I mean laws and taxes, and by ‘incentivising’ I mean subsidies, raising awareness, tax benefits for those companies that adopt sustainable solutions, etc.","Drivers: New potential energy sources can be a major driver for private adoption of sustainable space tech. Space energy sources could be an incredible investment, as they will become profitable in future, but you cannot use that energy if space isn’t clean. We might not feel the pressure of orbital pollution, but we do already notice and we do suffer from climate change on Earth. And that can be a major driver to invest in sustainable space tech. Both to prevent what is happening on Earth from happening in space too, and to help mitigate climate change on Earth (space for sustainability, earth observation, etc). There will always be the military aspect of space, and there are many private companies engaged in the defense sector. If orbital pollution becomes a major threat (and it, most likely will), then the defense would require sustainable space solutions to keep functioning smoothly in the space domain, therefore, private companies will have the incentive to develop sustainable space tech with the aim to sell it to the military. Barriers: It takes a long time to get a return on your investment. Investment propensity and adoption rate largely depend on stability, geopolitical environment, and currently it is a far cry from perfect. Unknown/rapidly changing set of regulations. It’s not clear who settles disputes, for example. Tech barriers. Operating in space is a difficult task, leaving no room for error, since it is a fully autonomous environment. Sustainability is oftentimes pushed for by the public, and the public is more preoccupied with what is happening on Earth, in their countries, in their regions. They would rather push their governments to clean up a river that runs in their region than pay for sustainable space. Same thing with investors: if they are environmentally conscious, they care about sustainable development, they would rather invest in something that would have a tangible impact on the society, where they live, for example, they could invest in a venture that filters the air from dangerous particles. Even though the world is globalized, and we want to believe that we think big as a society; in the end, we always care more about what happens locally.","There is always value in the data that allows us to predict things more accurately, that is why I see commercial value in your project. Autonomous systems are necessary in space, therefore there appears a market necessity to predict & avoid collisions - this is the commercial value for private companies and governmental agencies operating in space. The easier it is to make predictions - the better. Hence, the most processed data is the most useful one for private actors, who would not want to waste time and other resources on processing the half-ready data themselves. They want software that is intuitive, ready to be used, does not require special education to operate, and reduces their risk of losses (collision risks).   ROUND 2"
201,"I believe the space sustainability ecosystem should be organized much like the sustainability ecosystem on Earth. In the case of space debris removal, it's like waste management on Earth. Garbage is removed from your house by specific companies appointed by the state or your local community, and it's funded by taxpayers. You pay a communal tax, and your garbage is cleared using that money. In space, it should be very similar, with a particular focus on the principle of ""the more you pollute, the more you pay."" If Starlink launches hundreds of satellites, polluting with hundreds of thousands of tons from launchers taking off on Earth, and many of these satellites become debris, then the launching state (in this case, the US) should establish rules on how to remove and mitigate these activities. It also needs to be very well coordinated on the international level, which is not the case today. Currently, it's like the Wild West, where everyone basically does whatever they want. But ultimately, space sustainability should be part of a global sustainability effort. I think it’s a long path, but ultimately, it should be global. There should be mechanisms in place.","Regarding the barriers, I have already mentioned the international political environment, which hinders the creation of a positive and results-driven regulatory framework. The first barrier is the lack of a regulatory environment. The second is funding for space sustainability projects. Space is quite capital-intensive, lengthy, risky, and offers returns on investment that are quite different from other industries like retail or IT. In this context, sustainability programs are longer. There is significant interest in space and its sustainability; but access to funding is a crucial barrier to advancing these initiatives sooner rather than later. Additionally, I would point out the level of technological complexity as another barrier. When discussing space debris or in-orbit servicing, technologies such as capture, rendezvous, and proximity operations are exceedingly complex from a technological standpoint.  As for the positive drivers, space is becoming more privatized. There are many more private entities than there were 20, 30, or 50 years ago, making it somewhat similar to the IT or aviation industries. It is slightly regulated but is driven by private actors. SpaceX is the most prominent example.",
202,"Well, first of all, this question (and the answer to it) should be split in two: ‘Who should pay for future launches?’ and ‘Who should pay for the mess that is already there?’. In the second case, no company would or should take responsibility for it. Only states are responsible for it, so the answer is ‘only states should pay’. The answer to the first question is that it is possible to oblige companies to pay for it. For example, through UN treaties or ITU that regulates telecommunication: it has some leverage. And for the future, the solution could be the UN: whoever is responsible for the launch should have an obligation to pay for any measures that need to be taken to maintain the space ‘clean’, available for future launches, and sustainable.","A company should be big enough, so you cannot expect startups to pay for sustainable solutions, in space or on Earth, but in space specifically, because they already face huge expenses: the space sector is capital-intensive. So, from a certain size - yes, a private company could be an adopter of sustainable technologies in space. But not small, and not even medium companies. Then, we need to remember that the main task of the company is to do whatever it was created for. So, it would adopt a technology if it concerns its core business. For example, take a satellite constellation operator - they would need to make sure nothing collides with their satellites, so they could invest in a tracking, like a live dynamic model of the skies solution. But not because they are deeply concerned about sustainability (or maybe they are, I don’t know), but because they need to avoid collisions in order to maintain their core business. So, this is key - the factor of whether it concerns a company’s core business or not. If not, a private company wouldn’t bother; unless they are forced by law, of course. Companies that are running large constellations would be prime customers. They are both big in size and their core activities would suffer if they don’t implement those solutions. And in general, we can see that generally it is the big companies that try to push sustainability. Barriers. Of course costs. And they will stay high. Sustainability is a burden, companies don’t want a financial burden. A solution to the problem can be insurance. But the bottom line is: commercialisation of sustainable space technologies is entirely possible. We need to look at the policies of the big spacefaring nations. They have the most space assets, so they would be most interested in sustainability in space. First of all, they need to differentiate between launchers and satellite operators. It’s for policies, for sustainable space technologies development. There are, of course, special cases, like space stations. States need to share both successes and responsibilities with private companies. It should become normal to care.",
203,"It depends on the program, which will be the final use case for the technologies. It can be private funding, but it can also be public funding because it is a public regulation that imposes the obligation to make use of sustainable technologies. So, the main driver is the final use case. If it is for a public program, then it is in the interest of the public sector, the institutional world, so it means that it is the public sector that shall pay for the technology development. If it is for commercial end-users, like telecom or commercial exploration, then it means for me that it has to be, as a minimum, co-funded by the private sector. Whoever benefits from this technology in the end has to pay for the technology development.","It depends on regulations, because I believe that the private sector will have no interest in investing in any sustainable technology if they are not forced to do so. For the moment, they use technologies that are already qualified, mature, and the need to implement new technologies has always to either improve the performance, which could be the case if you want to develop something lighter or more performing, or with an extended lifetime, or for an equivalent performance which is cheaper. So, in that case, there is a direct motivation for the end-user to invest into the qualification, considering there is a return on investment. If we think only about the fact that the technology is more sustainable, it means that it does not provide any additional performance, it does not provide any gain, it just permits compliance with green rules.","For sure, there is an interest to map and monitor any debris. For the moment, I believe it is already done, but maybe the question revolves around the minimum size of the debris we are able to track. If you improve that, it will be interesting for sure. Who is interested in knowing what the debris is, where they are located, how much risk it represents for space assets in general? It is the army, national agencies or international agencies, it is the operators that are intending to fly in specific orbits that can be already pretty messy with such debris. Are they interested in getting additional information? I cannot tell you. And then, is there any commercial potential with such technology? It is clear that all the armies are very much interested in SSA, SDA, whatever it comes from ground sensors or in-orbit sensors. Most of the information that is used to do some SSA or SDA activities are coming from ground sensors, so it would be additional sensors. There is always the willingness to have your own information. If you are able to develop a system that permits to track and which is located at a certain place, then it means that you are able to consolidate some analysis yourself, some observation yourself, not only based on information you will receive from outside, like the space track catalog from the US Space Command, but also from self-owned assets you have on the ground. So it is always interesting to have additional information and be as autonomous as you can, but which is the commercial value you could have with such a type of service, I cannot tell you. The problem with the XaaS model is: are you sure there is a market for that? And whether there is a market or not, you will discover only having some business development activities, but if you do not have the pressure of the return on investment you have made, it means you have time, you have no investor to make happy. It's a low-risk initiative, so no reason not to try."
204,"I think space actors should pay. There should be a sharing between private space actors and public space actors, particularly since launching states remain liable. The main launching states, such as the US, Russia, and China, have much more responsibility in terms of space debris. I believe they should pay more for the debris currently in outer space. I'm in favor of a sharing arrangement between the private and public sectors, according to the number of spacecraft in orbit.","It's clear that incentives by the law, both national and international, are necessary. However, it's also crucial to measure and quantify properly the risks caused by space debris and unreasonable behavior in outer space. Space law is not as flawed as some might think. People used to criticize space law as being inadequate because there was no law in outer space, which is not true. There is a law, there is a system, but we need to be more accurate in defining the right behaviors in outer space to quantify the risks caused by bad behavior. Behaviors like not coordinating with others, not sharing orbital data, and creating new debris are really dangerous and should be quantified. Actors should pay for the risks imposed by national law or insurance.","I've often heard that space traffic and accessibility should be free, as it's fashionable to think everything should be free. However, there is work involved, and it's normal to pay for that. But regarding space debris, there is already data available on the web from organizations like ESA or NASA. It's hard to say without seeing the exact commercial scheme or business plan. It's in the interest of all space actors to access the most accurate data on space debris possible. If the system is only available for a significant fee that smaller actors cannot afford, it could be problematic and cause more damage. There should be a financially feasible scheme so that everyone can afford this access, as equal access to space is crucial. This access is becoming increasingly difficult due to space debris and the complexities of space traffic, which raises barriers for newcomers to access space.  XaaS is a feasible approach to maintain public funding for basic research while transitioning to private sector exploitation when ready. If efficient, larger actors might significantly contribute to this system, enhancing global security in outer space."
205,"In my opinion, we first need to differentiate between an ideal world and what is realistic. In the ideal world, of course, everything would be regulated by international agreements, between all the spacefaring nations, which is now almost all the nations. I do not think it’s the governments’ duty to pay. They should mandate it. And then every satellite that is launched only gets permission to be launched if they have a solution on how to bring it down. And then, if it’s a commercial mission, that it’s part of their finances, they should calculate this in. But it starts with a government mandate.  Now we know that it is not possible for all the countries, but at least the western world should be a good example and government mandated regulations in place.","A Government mandate is a pretty good incentive, if they [satellite operators] cannot launch otherwise. Apart from this, I think, in the commercial world, if the technology makes it cheaper, better, faster, one of the three, two of the three or ideally three of the three, then they would adopt it. If not, then it has to be government mandated. Companies would hardly go for more expensive solutions just because they are sustainable, just because of their good will. ESA, NASA can do that, but not the commercial world.","If it is a global problem, it should be open-sourced. Just a general statement. If there is a commercial service that has better information about space debris, it could become of interest for satellite placement for future missions, because it becomes more and more difficult to find orbital positions, to avoid space debris and so on. You know, if there is an added value that you can deliver to a company to give them a recommendation about an orbit placement, there could be some value as well. I think you could also go for a hybrid approach, where you have a raw database, because then you also have contributions from other entities, and it could grow and become more interesting. But then you sell value-added services on top. And then I would even go a step further and extrapolate into the future on how space debris moves and evolves, having certain statistics as well (e. g., for how long is the orbit safe, how safe). So, a potential roadmap is to open-source it and make others make their contributions. Then you need to have some quality checks. There are space debris databases. There is NASA, ESA. Additionally, collision avoidance would be an interesting service to provide. Commercial entities would be extremely interested in it. If you can provide data for smaller particles, because even a 1-cm object can have a devastating impact on the ISS or a satellite. You can even take some proactive approach, if you can predict a collision, you go to a satellite operator and you tell them ‘hey, you are on a collision course. if you want the data, pay us!’"
206,"I think it all depends on the spectrum of what you define as sustainable in space. In terms of applications, technologies, but it can also be the behaviour of space actors.  I think governments definitely should support and fund researchers, but the responsibility, I believe, should rather be held by operators, who are physically engaging in space activities. And then we should put this on top of the agenda, as a priority, with the support of governments. This most likely will change overtime. The way I could picture that is how it was in air transport. It used to be an idea and concept and now it has become a clear part of any business application. If you fly on a commercial plane now, you can take personal actions about your sustainability impact. And also at plane construction they select certain applications and technologies. And I think that space will follow a similar path, where responsibility would be diluted across multiple axes, and supported by states.","I think it is connected to the mentality of people and to society. More and more we see that sustainability now is an inherent part of any business. Predominantly because of social pressure and social norms around this conventional use of resources that we have had so far. For too long it was ok for companies to do whatever they want, with impunity on the impact and no repercussions for their activities. And I think now the mindset of the general public will push companies to actually act responsibly about their in-space flights and in-space activities. This is a very Western way of seeing this concept, and it would be very interesting to analyze this concept with different mindsets coming from new companies or new countries starting space exploration, for example, India, China, other Asian and Latin American countries that have also evolved to space exploration to see if they share a similar mindset. My thinking is that perhaps we are a couple of years ahead of their mindset, because they will first want to prove their technology before taking an action to make it sustainable. And I think it’s a step by step approach, we are more far ahead, meaning that our companies will have to integrate sustainability in their actions, otherwise they would not have any credibility among the population and the public at large. But other nations still have a couple of years ahead before it becomes required and mandatory.","I think both a commercial path and an open-source path are possible. I’ve seen on the market many actors actually pursuing both endeavors by segmenting their data in a timely manner. So, the open data for the safety of space activities is critical nowadays, and should always be considered. But information is key, and accuracy and timeliness of information make it even more valuable. I think to be able to continue offering free information that can be fully accessible, you need funding, and a good way to do funding is obviously to go commercial. The way I would approach this topic, is to offer subscriptions (commercial side) in a time-sensitive manner, meaning that any update within X hours will be accessible. But then this update will be delayed by several days before it is open-sourced and reaches the general public. And so you basically have a premium access and premium knowledge on what is happening, and for that you would pay a premium price. And doing this can be very useful for key actors, for example, insurance companies, because they would want to know  what orbits are polluted or are expected to become polluted, meaning, the risk of collisions is increased, meaning that the premium they would have to pay for insurance will also be increased. But also for coordination of activities, orbital transfer, large-scale maneuvers that will happen  in different orbits that is also the prime information that you would want to know ahead of everyone else, because then you would want to take preliminary action and not just consult an open-source environment."
207,"Probably a combination [of public and private money]. Actually, it depends on the type of the mission. You have two types of space activities: institutional space driven by space agencies (ESA, NASA, JAXA, ISRO, etc) and on the other side you have New Space missions, commercial missions, and some of them are driven by the agencies, but most of the missions are commercial missions. So, for institutional space, as it has public funding, it is paid by us, taxpayers, and it should take sustainability into account in the budget granted by the agencies. Regarding commercial activities, sustainability will probably be paid for by the end-user. The costs will be diluted, integrated, consolidated into the price of the service provided by these missions. But in any case, my belief is that it is complete nonsense to allow billionaires to send thousands or tens of thousands of objects into space without having any possibility to bring them back. At least there should be a tax. Probably, it should be managed by the UN or a kind of consortium of all the space agencies. Because the problem can prevent our great-grandchildren from sending anything to space! It is like pollution on earth.","If in the end, it is cheaper for them to use it than not use it, they would adopt such a technology. For instance, SpaceX is using the same rocket several times. Obviously, they say it is to prevent pollution (and, it is the case), but it is in fact because it is less expensive. And today ArianeSpace is looking into a solution like that to decrease the price. The purpose of a private company is to create profit. So, it is either you force companies to use sustainable components and solutions, or these sustainable components and solutions are cheaper. And these are the only two solutions.","If you want to broadcast and if you want to have an impact on the industry, then open-source it, combine with training sessions, performing API, and ergonomic solutions. And you will be paid for the training sessions, for the expertise and not for your data. Space is a complex field, and companies are operating under short timeframes. They would not want to waste too much time figuring out how to use your technology, they want quick solutions. Open source it for everyone, so that academics, who have more time and patience, can learn how to use your technology by themselves. And, maybe, they would also contribute with their data. And then you sell training sessions to companies.  So, if you really want to address the private market, open-source is the right solution, but with added services which will obviously not be free. I guess it is the best solution. I used to work in software, and from my experience, if you want to address the private market,  open-source data is never enough. You need to teach people, you need to provide them with solutions that will help them to process the data and use it for their own needs. And these side activities will generate some revenue for you. But the data itself should be free, without any IP. It is an intermediate solution. With this solution you would address part of the market, but most of the companies would probably prefer embedding your solution  in their solution. So, some of the companies accept external IPs in their solutions, but most of them want to export, they don’t want to negotiate with third parties if they are allowed or not allowed to use the IPs. I think you constrain your market. But obviously, it is a solution, and you can explore it."
208,"The problem we are facing is very complex, with many different cases to consider. For infrastructure used by all of society, it is up to society to pay. Take navigation for example: if you want a sustainable system, society should fund it. Currently, this service is free, so the costs are covered by governments or the organizations that set up these systems, who also must cover sustainability costs. In the case of military systems, these are government-funded. For telecommunications, which often involve private companies, the end user ultimately bears the cost. This cost is passed down from the company, ensuring they retain their benefits. In any scenario, whether through government-funded systems or services like telecommunications, costs are passed on to citizens through taxes or subscriptions.Ultimately, whatever the system, citizens end up paying for more sustainable services in the long run.","Private companies will only adopt sustainability practices if mandated by law, otherwise, they will pass the costs onto consumers. Two decades later, the U.S. authorized a plan for 10,000 satellites in LEO, ignoring warnings due to economic incentives and strategic advantages, even anticipating similar actions from China and Russia. I am skeptical of national governments implementing effective laws in this area, given their past inaction. The only feasible solution might be an international treaty enforced by user demand, acknowledging the convenience of global satellite coverage provided by initiatives like those proposed by Elon Musk. This might be the only way to regulate and limit the deployment of satellites effectively. Legislation limited to one government, to one country, will have no effect. That means if Switzerland decides to do better, or even France or the European Space Agency impose, and they try to impose this now, they want to be more constrained and so on, to be more sustainable, it's about 5% of the satellites, all European contribution. That means you have the US, you have China, we have Russia. And if the major players are not the drivers of that, any action will be without any effect, or negligible effect. The initiative which contributes to having clean airspace, clean space, the 80 million given by the Space Agency for this mission, at the origin I remember the speech of Isaac Eventon. He said, we want to be the leader of sustainability, we want the 150 satellites of ESA that have been launched over the last 40 to 50 years to be removed. And that by 2035, there are no more ESA satellites in orbit that are not in operation. We are 10 years later, clean space, still working to try to remove the first debris, which is maybe now a small satellite. We have not moved 2% of the way, of the objective of the ESA directors in Europe, of 70 of them. Speech, word, no action. You have billions for science, the ESA mission, 1.5 billion. Many others, you have, I think, the typical budget of ESA for science is 1 billion a year, a few tens of millions for sustainability. Even when the director declares it's over. Only, only legislative, strong legislation, ESA agreed, good. But to reach that, how to put the same table, Russian, American, Russia and China, that they make decisions, that they will take care of the sustainability of space. You see what is the status today. 30 years ago, I had some hope, because in 2000, there was a real discussion between the US, Russia, China, Europe. We were in a much, much better situation to progress. And we do so little. We miss, we miss an opportunity 20 years ago, clearly, for that. But the situation, the international situation today, doesn't give me any hope about this until we have a much smoother situation.","One opportunity within Elon Musk's constellation involves having 20 satellites for telecommunication and one satellite dedicated to stability, removal, monitoring, etc. In such cases, collaboration with such a player is possible. You could propose integrating a function in their system that enhances sustainability, potentially increasing system costs by about 5%. This added cost is reasonable and could attract private companies to contribute.  Currently, the technology developed in this domain primarily diagnoses problems and monitors them, but real-time monitoring that can prevent collisions has not yet been achieved. It contributes to understanding and statistically tracking problem evolution over time. The challenge is converting this into value for a company. Operators are aware that this database is available at no cost, or at least accessible. They can make statistical analyses, assess collision probabilities, and consider risks. Failures in space are common, so when planning, an operator might expect a 90% operational probability for a certain duration. Every ten satellites might see one failure. The tools provided should enhance knowledge or predict the viability and operational duration of systems. If these tools were free, operators would be delighted. However, if your tools offer significant added value, enabling more precise designs or operational decisions in less risky orbits, it creates value for the operator. This might involve adjusting satellite altitudes or slightly enlarging solar panels to account for potential degradation, translating costs into clear benefits for the operator. Operators need to perceive a tangible value against the costs. This value might even be a form of greenwashing, allowing them to claim they invest a portion of their profits or emissions into sustainable research and monitoring. Alternatively, the value might be more direct and technical, quantifiable through improved satellite longevity or reliability. Furthermore, the value could be reputational or ethical, enhancing a company’s image by demonstrating a commitment to addressing space debris. This could also form a foundation for developing other tools, such as dynamic maps of space debris, providing a starting point for further integration and development. What is the added value? Is it for the company, the operator, or the government? From an engineering point of view, you can explain the improvements to the system or predictions if we collaborate, but is it simply relying on existing, already established systems? What is the added value you bring? You can explain this to an engineer like me, but if I want to convince the financial team to fund this additional data, I need to demonstrate the value clearly. This could be justified through a purely technical rationale or by enhancing the company's image, which, though less tangible, is still significant."
209,"There are two distinct questions to consider: ‘who should pay’ and ‘who will actually pay’. In the end, most of the costs will be borne by the government. They are the ones who put regulations in place, they are the biggest customers and biggest adopters of space technologies. They are paying for most of the space infrastructure. Even the bigger private companies, like SpaceX, get a lot of governmental funding. To sum it up, it will be the public sector.","Regulation is hard, because, if there are restrictions in one country, a company can avoid them by moving abroad. One way to solve this problem is to do what the US is doing: their space industry is so developed and attractive, that companies lean there, despite the US imposing some regulations. Key nations that control access to space need to have common standards and guidelines. The other way around it is to have a technology that is inherently sustainable and is so good that companies want to apply it because of its utility. If the new technology allows us to do things better, companies would use it, but not at an extra cost. A problematic point is geopolitical tensions.  Also there is no number (at least, I have not seen it) to put to a point after which things will get really bad. Like ‘we can launch these many more satellites, and then things will deteriorate dramatically’. So we need to quantify the risks and communicate them better.","I think you can take a dual approach. If companies want to pay, they expect a ready product. it is hard to sell raw data, they need ready solutions, ready answers to their questions. For example: “Is it safe to deploy our constellations in this orbit?”. This you can sell.  At the same time, they want transparency, so they would also want to see the raw data to be able to compare it to other raw data and ensure consistency. I see it as a consulting service. Since you are the ones creating the dataset, you know it the best, so you could sell knowledge to companies and governments. If you could really quantify the risks, that would be especially valuable. Particularly to insurance companies, because when a satellite operator wants to insure their satellite, an insurance company would want to have the most accurate and objective image of potential dangers. To sum up, both commercial and non-commercial paths can be combined. You really need to show people that your data is solid, but complex, so you can help companies figure out how to use your insights to help their businesses."
210,"As we see in many other domains, it should be the polluter to pay. Whoever offers a service, or benefits from the service, at the end of the day, should be the one to offset the environmental costs of the said service. We see it in other domains, like, a company who operates a nuclear reactor, they pay to a fund that takes care of minimizing negative side-effects. Insurance companies look at it too. Why should a state pay, or people should pay, for the damage that companies do while generating revenues? Especially in the context of private companies, This immediately brings up the question of regulations, because if it is not regulated, companies will not pay for it.","External regulations can certainly be a factor, but there is also self-regulation. Let's assume you are a company like SpaceX, with thousands of satellites in orbit. You would be concerned about collisions in the orbit where you have hundreds of thousands of assets. This presents a considerable risk that your business could be disrupted to a certain extent. Therefore, companies operating in a specific region would have a significant interest in ensuring that they do not become orbital debris themselves and would aim to reduce the risk of their operations being hampered by accidents, particularly collisions.It all depends on how the ecosystem evolves; it could very well be primarily about the protection of their own assets. Companies would want to ensure that their orbits remain relatively clean. We are talking here mostly about mega-constellations, large constellations, because these are the ones with the highest risks. Therefore, they are motivated to work together on a system where they can ensure reduced collision risks and debris formation.","The question is: how systematically do you cover the sky with your observations? In the context of space traffic management with large constellations in orbit, we need structure. Currently, there is no problem with managing orbital traffic, but soon we will need smart systems that allow satellites to avoid collisions. Who will coordinate it? Who will be responsible? Space traffic management is very data-driven. Having data to measure different objects is valuable and can contribute to developing a more comprehensive space traffic management system, which we will soon urgently need. This is one aspect; the other is to have as complete a picture of the sky as possible.From your explanation, you seem to be in the research domain, explaining how a satellite is tumbling, what is happening to a satellite, and even spotting space debris. You do not have a full picture of the space traffic but can see smaller objects, making it more research-related than business-related. Therefore, making it open source would allow other observatories to contribute. If you still want to pursue commercial avenues, you might offer your know-how. While it is limited in scope, you can demonstrate its applicability to other cases. At this stage, I see these two domains.Looking at the market, NORAD is trying to commercialize it. Several companies are becoming active in this domain, which could lead to technological breakthroughs that help develop more commercial opportunities.There is always the possibility to keep it open source and have many partners contribute to it. As a researcher, you invest in hardware and software, but it's uncertain if you will find sufficient data to complement your database. The Swiss Space Office and the army might be interested.If we ever have state-organized space traffic management, then state-owned sensors will also be used. They might be interested in your methodology, but not your archives, as they would have their own trusted sources of data. Hopefully, coordination will be conducted on a global scale. Who will take the lead remains an open question. It is quite difficult to get major countries—the US, Europe, Russia, China, India—to agree on which model to use and how to divide responsibilities and tasks. Perhaps in the civil sector, we might see such coordination, but the military sector will, of course, always remain closed.The new EU space law that was recently introduced might be of interest to you, as it will impact European space. This is certainly something to look into.This issue is recognized in the community, but it remains unclear whether it will be organized top-down or bottom-up."
211,"I think it shouldn't just be one party. Aviation might be the closest analogy—just as aircraft and ships in international waters are regulated; space, although free in principle, can be similarly governed. If there are regulations, then the entities that want to exploit space will have to comply. I believe the cost should ultimately be shared. There should be a responsibility to not just launch whatever you want and then leave someone else to clean up. That’s not the right strategy for me.","Companies tend to go for the lowest cost and the easiest path by default. For instance, in the case of insurances, there’s an external incentive model where safer practices might allow more exploitation rights. But generally, if the companies themselves don’t see immediate repercussions or benefits, they won’t change their practices. However, increased public concern can pressure companies to act responsibly because they wouldn’t want to be seen in a bad light.","Regarding its commercial potential or whether it should remain as an open-source academic project, I believe such a tool that enhances sustainability should benefit everyone. Ideally, it should be open-source, similar to how Google Maps started. This approach allows the community to contribute, enhancing its functionalities, such as possibly predicting dynamic collisions in the future. Starting it as an open-source project allows us to gain and give back to the community, which could lead to potential monetization strategies later on, similar to the model used by Linux. This could allow companies to decide whether the basic open-source version meets their needs or if a commercial version with additional features and support is worth investing in."
212,"There has to be an international collaboration between key spacefaring nations to coordinate legislation. And they should tell all the other countries: we will only partner with you in the space sector, if you meet our sustainable conditions. Space exploration is unimaginable without close partnerships between countries. Therefore, it could be the main leverage to develop and use sustainable space solutions. And now we need to have some more precise estimations on the environmental effect of space activities to motivate the states to unite and impose those conditions. If the effect is negligible, then why bother?","Relevance for people and their quality of life. For example, preventing satellites/rocket parts from falling into oceans, onto people’s homes. Or making the process of manufacturing satellites more sustainable (like, decreasing the amount of plastic used in satellite production), because we want to avoid emitting too much greenhouse gasses and harmful particles into the air that we breathe. As for the orbital pollution, I do not think there are enough satellites and debris now in orbit for private companies to get truly concerned, and therefore to start investing in cleaning up the path for themselves. From the standpoint of manufacturing satellites, there are commercial opportunities, because it would impact the Earth ecology directly. Also, we can consider sustainability as a ‘side effect’. For instance, we optimize production, supply chain, fuel consumption during launch in order, first of all, to reduce the costs, but it also has sustainability benefits. Also, there is the factor of noise pollution. It can be interesting, because it directly impacts people. So, in order to be commercially successful, a sustainable space technology must target a need that is tangible and noticeable directly on Earth and has an almost immediate effect on the quality of people’s life. That’s why I doubt that any company in the near future would be interested, for example, in solutions for preserving the lunar environment. It must be visible now and here. Sustainable space technologies are financed from the pocket of taxpayers, so taxpayers must feel the benefits. In a nutshell, noise reduction, transportation/supply chain optimization - these are the best angles to approach space sustainability from a commercial point of view. And of course, efficiency. A sustainable space technology requires capital and resources, so it must maximize the effect to be commercially interesting. So, minimal investment and maximum effect. For instance, take ‘hour of earth’. It’s an initiative, when people turn off the light for an hour to help economize electricity. But the truth is - the effect is negligible, but the efforts to raise awareness about this initiative are enormous. This is a huge disparity between the effort and the effect. For commercial sustainable technologies it must not be this way. They should apply minimal force to the spot with the most change potential.","XaaS is a good idea, but simply giving access is not enough. You might consider producing some manuals to help private adopters figure out how to navigate your repository. Or you can offer companies to process their data using your methodology, and they would pay for your work. then, you would use your repository as a demonstration of what you can do."
213,"Mostly private players pollute orbits. Also, the orbits are controlled by nobody. So, someone should take control and enforce it. If you want to go to LEO or GEO, you need to get your mission approved before you go. Just like in the aviation sector, they have the power to deny you access to the skies. NASA is going in the direction of delegating activities to private companies, and it becomes messy. So, someone should take the responsibility.","When it comes to commercializing sustainable space technologies, I do not see how it can be profitable. Unless the government is your customer. Maybe you can make it profitable by recycling the space debris in orbit. The companies might find it profitable to use the materials already circling the earth for their purposes.","There is such a technology developed at TU Darmstadt. It’s like, who’s paying for air traffic control? It’s not profitable per se, but it is essential, so someone does pay for it, and private companies benefit from the security that it provides. So, yeah, possibly, whoever wants to ensure that the satellites are operated properly should pay for such a tool."
214,"I think it should ultimately be a combination of both, but initially, it should be more weighted towards the government for several reasons. One of the big issues with sustainable space is all the debris currently up there, much of which comes from national state-sponsored missions. Addressing this would necessarily have to be funded by the government, as no commercial company would spend their own money removing objects that are already up there. So initially, at least, there would need to be a lot of government funding to mitigate these risks to spacecraft, which will always be present until they're deorbited or moved to a different orbit. Additionally, government funding is necessary to support the technology development needed for many of these commercial missions. For example, developing end-of-life services (removing a spacecraft if it failed at the end of its life) is a commercial activity because the spacecraft operator would want that spacecraft removed, it's a high-risk technology that requires significant investment and governmental support to become commercially viable.In the longer term, sustainable space operations would be funded by commercial organizations through their own revenue, covering their own costs for things like insurance as well. However, this would require the government to mandate that operators remove their spacecraft at the end of life, and therefore they would need to budget for that as part of the mission.","It's a combination of carrot and stick. The stick, or the regulatory side, would involve national regulators setting clear rules for what satellite operators can do and the consequences for non-compliance, such as fines. For example, a US space operator was recently fined because they didn't deorbit their satellite in the correct period. This could be a way to trick operators into following new regulations, but this will require agreement among nations. It's all very well if the UK, for instance, enforces strict regulations, but if operators could simply move to France or Germany, then it doesn't really matter. There has to be a consistent agreement among a critical mass of national regulators. The carrot involves reducing costs or generating new revenue. If spacecraft operators can cut costs by using reusable rockets or cheaper satellite materials, or if in-orbit servicing enables new business models like space-based solar power, that creates a new market and financial incentives for using sustainable approaches.","I think if the repository has specific information about large debris objects, if you could provide information on the rotation rate and its configuration; then that has value to companies that would be looking to do active debris removal or end of life services or something like that. And certainly from my experience in satellite operation, we would pay a reasonable amount of money to get that information so that we knew that when we built the spacecraft to go up there and remove it we knew exactly what it was doing before we got there. Without that information it's quite risky. But it's a very specific use case: there's only a handful of companies that perhaps would want to pay for that information and they would just look at a handful of objects. It depends somewhat on whether active debris removal becomes a real, well-funded activity; and a lot of the things already out there are state-owned, they're quite old. I don't think you'd probably bother with the Russians at the moment, I don't think that would work out very well.I think the problem with having it open source is that we have our own database of imagery which could, in theory, support projects like yours. However, it costs a lot of money to acquire that imagery, so we can't maintain an open source repository; it's all commercialized as a service. If people want that data, they have to pay for it because it's too costly for us to provide freely. I don't know if you face the same issue or whether you can obtain your data more cost-effectively. You could kind of do both: you could have a limited open source repository where there is some data about some well-known objects that could be used for, I mean, I don't truly know what the purpose of the repository might be, but it could be for academic collaboration or studying the dynamics of space debris or something like that. And that could be an open source repository. Then, you could have another repository that is far more detailed about other objects, which might also be sensitive. That would be a paid service."
215,"When we are talking about ‘should’, I would say both governments and companies. But in the end, it will be governments through taxpayers money maintaining the space environment.","I think it has a political impact. It is like a gold rush at the moment - look at how many big constellations are being planned right now. It is the ‘winner takes it all’ mentality. Like we see with IT companies, like Google as the market leader. SpaceX will occupy an orbit and make it unattractive to competitors. The US are quite aware of the risks, but it is difficult for them to balance economic and geopolitical interests. I think people are aware of the risks, there is just no solution, or nobody wants to stop it to a certain extent. There are also new challenges coming in, for example, disintegrating satellites in the atmosphere leaves dangerous amounts of particles there, and we didn’t realize it before.","What you could do is to keep it open-source so that other teams like yourselves can add more information to it. There is little value in archived data from a handful of observatories. You first need to make it more comprehensive. Once you have acquired enough data to make a map of skies (not necessarily dynamic even), you can try to partially commercialize it. I do not think that it will ever pay off in full, in the end, the initial costs were enormous, I assume, but you can streamline it for the industry and let them pay for your information on density clouds. But, once again, first you need to acquire a sufficient volume of information by open-sourcing the repository and methodology, so that others can apply your methodology on their data, otherwize there will be no uniformity.  ROUND 3"
301,"Probably a combination. Someone should feel responsible for whatever is sent to space, so the entity launching anything into space should be responsible for what is sent.","I would say ethics should, in principle, push companies to do things right. But if you look at the past and other domains, this didn’t necessarily work that way. So the main drivers for companies are probably money. Either they make money from sustainable technologies, or they need to pay penalties if they don’t use them. Money might be the main factor. And this is if we stay in a regime where having a low Earth orbit asset is still possible. It’s in everyone’s interest to keep the lower half of low Earth orbit as clean as possible so that everyone can enjoy it. So I guess, in a reasonable regime, money, and also to avoid Kessler syndrome, where this part of space is not useful or usable anymore.","That's one way to use public money to stimulate the private sector. I guess most of the time it's probably fine, but ethically, using public money to generate revenue for private companies is questionable. Initially, public money was not meant to generate revenue for the private sector. I don't think that was the original intention. This money might have been wasteful, but maybe it wasn't. I don't know. I'm not a politician."
302,"Space does not belong to anyone but also space belongs to everyone. I think, ideally, it should be the government that pays because it's the tax money they collect from the citizens of countries. Mainly, the governments of the space-faring nations should be responsible for funding sustainable space exploration. But at the same time, now that we see the commercial part of space exploration becoming more common with so many private players coming in, they should also contribute to having a more sustainable exploration.Private players shouldn’t only focus on profits and business; rather, they should adopt a more sustainable approach and work with the government to fund sustainable space technologies.","One of the main motivations for companies should be to continue their work and not just seek momentary business or profit for a couple of years without being able to sustain their business. If you want something to continue, it should be sustainable enough to keep working for a few decades or more. That’s a major motivation.If they are visionaries looking into the future of their business, they should adopt more sustainable practices and, most importantly, learn from what we have done to Earth. Instead of going for quick profits, they should think about how space can be utilized for the long term. Another motivation could be incentives from the government or policymakers driving space exploration. Recently, directives by sustainable space organizations have offered incentives for sustainable private players, and several companies have signed deals to be sustainable and carry on the legacy of space exploration.","In a commercial context, ODLI data would be very useful for any satellite operator or company planning to send anything to space. They can plan their missions based on this data, including their orbits and astrodynamics. This is definitely useful for satellite companies and academics involved in mission planning and launching satellites. Open source is always more useful for academics. If you can open source some part of it or provide a trial version for academics to use and provide feedback, that could be a good approach. You could provide free access to academics while private companies pay a fee, or offer a demo version with limited access to the general public and different subscription modes."
303,"In my opinion, space development and sustainable operations should ultimately be driven by the private sector. However, in the initial phase, the government, which has numerous projects and resources, should focus on fundamental research and challenging orbital operations. Once such technology is established, the private sector should play an important role in sustaining these activities. Meanwhile, the government and academia should focus on inventing new technologies. Utilization should be the responsibility of the industrial sector.","Private companies should learn how to generate financial profit from these activities. For example, the government should fund startups to accelerate new trials and attempts. We need to establish an economic ecosystem to facilitate this money flow. Currently, many space technology startups struggle to sustain their activities due to financial issues. In the USA, the economic system supports companies through initial failures, allowing them to gain knowledge and know-how. However, in Japan, media often criticize space trials that fail due to the high costs involved, making it difficult for these endeavors to be sustainable. It's essential to involve more public domains in supporting these crucial challenges for humanity. The mass media plays a critical role. Programs like Space Daily are important, but they often don't receive enough public attention.","This is an important question. From my perspective, I'm not sure how many industrial sectors pay attention to open source software. Academic researchers often rely on open source resources due to limited funding. However, industrial sectors may not pay much attention to open source software, as they often use internally developed tools. Directly advertising open source tools to specific companies can be effective. Large industrial companies may not initially be aware of the benefits of open source software compared to their proprietary tools. Direct communication with relevant companies is crucial to demonstrate the advantages of open source tools. Feedback from these companies can help decide whether to open source the software or license it to specific companies."
304,"It should be a combination of both. If only the government pays, they would also be paying for commercial players who make money with space activities. Conversely, if only commercial players pay, there are satellites that are institutional and based on government research, like Copernicus, involving big agencies. It wouldn’t be fair for commercial players to shoulder all the costs. A pro-rata model, where the cost is based on the extent of space usage and the operational lifetime, would be fairer.","A space law is necessary. Without laws and standards that people must follow, compliance won't happen. It's similar to the CO2 footprint; if people are not obliged to pay, they won’t. This should be a global rule, not just a national one. Otherwise, only one country would contribute, and those with the most output would avoid paying due to the high costs.","Combining datasets with dynamic datasets could enhance their usefulness, especially for tracking smaller debris. Integrating machine learning with optical systems on CubeSats, Starlinks, or Kuipers to analyze live data could be beneficial. It’s important to establish a common language for these datasets to ensure compatibility. Regarding open sourcing, a trial period could be useful. Open source the dataset for six months to a year, gather feedback, and then decide whether to move to a licensing model. A low-cost licensing model could allow continued access while supporting further development. Offering free access for research purposes to those enhancing the dataset could also be an effective approach. This combined model allows for the intake of user feedback to improve the dataset or tool."
305,"It's extremely difficult because every country needs to agree on it, and you have no power over it. It's like the gold rush in space. In my opinion, the first to pay would be the user. When you send equipment into space, you should take into account the impact, as is the case on the ground. Normally, you have the policy, ""polluter pays."" If you have to pay more to put something in space, the downstream will also pay more because the service will cost more. So, in the end, it's extremely difficult to implement because there is no agreement between countries. I don't know how to enforce that because you need a legal base. Without one, the industry is not willing to pay for pollution, even if in the long term, the effect will also be detrimental to the companies. The government has to enforce that, but from an international point of view. If you follow the principle of ""polluter pays,"" it means that there is a certain tax that a company pays to their government, which then implements sustainable solutions, like cleaning up the orbits. I don't know if it's a good model or if it works, but this is what's done on the ground. I think it's probably the way because the effect has a lot of costs to add sustainability to the space systems. Who is willing to pay for that?","The problem with sustainability is there is no added value, purely financially speaking. In the long term, for sure, because if you completely pollute and cannot use it, but it's short term, and I know that most companies, at least the public ones, have a pace which is a trimester. So they have to show good results every trimester.","Satellite operators might not want to insert their satellites in this orbit or choose another one, based on your information on density clouds. Or it could be for someone who is actually creating a dynamic map of skies. They need the initial data, and the methodology on how to identify space debris. It's a really difficult case. Maybe the insurances could be your customers. They can also force the operator. Maybe once the risk will increase related to the collision of debris, these insurances could be the leverage. Because they are paying if there is an issue. And if they are paying, they will invoice more to the company or ask for more safety for the flights. but it depends on the levels of actual risk. There will not be so many NGOs interested in space. An NGO cannot live from space because they need to have people paying for what they are doing with animals, with poverty. With space, it's much more difficult. The distance, the remoteness is clearly an element. It's really not easy. We see the sustainability rating that was developed by our colleague and it's extremely difficult to sell it. There is no added value to that. Companies, it's not because they have money that they are willing to pay. Recently, I read a paper about finance and investments and there are less than 10% of the investors who are interested in sustainability.  We are speaking of people who have the money who would be able to potentially change things but they are not willing to."
